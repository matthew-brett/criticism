From Reading and writing in the time of Jesus, by Alan Millard.

Who wrote? in chapter 6

    ... instruction in the Torah started early according to both Philo and
    Josephus (Leg. Gai 210, Apion 2.178).

Philo is:

    210. for all men are eager to preserve their own customs and laws, and the
         Jewish nation above all others; for looking upon their laws as
         oracles directly given to them by God himself, and having been
         instructed in this doctrine from their very earliest infancy they
         bear in their souls the images of the commandments contained in these
         laws as sacred;

Josephus verse is:

    176 And indeed most men, far from living according to their own laws,
    hardly know what they are. Only when they have sinned do they learn from
    others that they have broken the law. 177 Even people in the highest and
    most important government posts admit to ignorance of the laws and are
    obliged to take on as consultants in public office people who are
    competent in those laws. 178 Among us, if you can ask about our laws
    anyone can recite them all as easily as his own name, since we have
    learned them from our earliest awareness, and have them as it were
    inscribed upon our souls. Few of us transgress them and, if any do offend,
    it is impossible to escape the punishment.
